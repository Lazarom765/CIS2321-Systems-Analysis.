# CIS2321-Systems-Analysis.

 - System Design: Unlike conventional elevators that operate in vertical shafts, horizontal elevators operate on a track system that allows lateral movement. This can be achieved using various methods such as linear motors, conveyor belts, or magnetic levitation.
   - Linear Motors: These can propel the elevator car along a straight or curved path. Linear motors provide smooth acceleration and deceleration, making them ideal for rapid horizontal travel.
   - Guidance System: A precise guidance system is crucial to ensure the elevator travels along its designated path without deviations. This could involve wheels, tracks, or magnetic guides.
   - Sensors and Alarms: Incorporating advanced sensors that detect obstructions or issues along the path is vital for safety.
   - Emergency Systems: Similar to vertical elevators, having emergency brakes and communication systems for passengers can enhance safety during unexpected situations.
   - Space Efficiency: Horizontal elevators can save space as they do not require a large vertical shaft. This can be particularly advantageous in densely populated urban areas.
   - Accessibility: They provide easier access for people with mobility challenges, as they can be installed at ground level.
   - Engineering Complexity: Designing a system that works effectively in a horizontal orientation involves complex engineering challenges regarding load distribution, stability, and mechanics.
   - Cost: The initial investment for developing and installing horizontal elevators can be significantly higher than conventional elevators.
  
   - What i learned in this class was that I gained a thorough grasp of all phases of the system development life cycle, including requirements collection, design, implementation, and maintenance. I discovered how to efficiently analyze and depict complicated systems using a variety of modeling tools, such as flowcharts and UML diagrams. Along with emphasizing the need of stakeholder participation and good communication, the course helped me work effectively with a variety of teams to make sure that system solutions meet the demands of users and organizational goals. In order to optimize and maintain reliable information systems, I also gained important problem-solving abilities and the capacity to assess system performance.
